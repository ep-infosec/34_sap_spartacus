# Technical Changes in Spartacus 6.0

## SSR and Prerendering

If you are using prerendering, you will need to provide the following function to your `AppServerModule`:

```ts
import { provideServer } from '@spartacus/setup/ssr';
@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [
    ...provideServer({
      serverRequestOrigin: process.env['SERVER_REQUEST_ORIGIN'],
    }),
    ...
  ],
})
export class AppServerModule {}
```

It is _mandatory_ to set the `serverRequestOrigin` option for the prerendering, as it can not be automatically resolved.

In SSR mode, it will be automatically resolved from the express server, therefore it doesn't have to be set via this option.
If explicitly set, this option will take precedence over the express server.
